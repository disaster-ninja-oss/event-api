# Severities - Event API

**Severity levels (in Kontur)**: TERMINATION, MINOR, MODERATE, SEVERE, EXTREME, UNKNOWN.
* Severity calculation**

The level of severity is calculated using different algorithms for different data:

1. **PDC's, GDACS's** severities. Cyclone, drought, earthquake, flood, storm, tornado, tsunami, volcano, wildfire, other: severity values match according to the table below (using field 'data', key 'severityId' from table data_lake).

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PDC** | **GDACS's**  | **Kontur** |
| TERMINATION |  | TERMINATION |
| INFORMATION | Minor | MINOR |
| ADVISORY | Moderate | MODERATE |
| WATCH | Severe | SEVERE |
| WARNING | Extreme | EXTREME |
|  | Unknown | UNKNOWN |

2. **Firms's** severities. Wildfire data:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Area** | **Duration** | **Severity** |
| any | <= 24 hours | MINOR |
| < 10 km2 | any | MINOR |
| \>= 10 km2 AND < 50 km2 | \> 24 hours | MODERATE |
| \>= 50 km2 AND < 100 km2 | \> 24 hours | SEVERE |
| \>= 100 km2  | \> 24 hours | EXTREME |

3. **EM-DAT's** severities:
